# QRSS Viewer
**QRSS Viewer is an an open source QRSS spectrograph for Windows.** It is written in C# and others are encouraged to modify it to their liking.

QRSS is a type of continuous wave (CW) radio signal which uses frequency-shift keying (FSK). QRSS is ultra-narrowband (5Hz bandwidth) and ultra slow speed (about 3 letters per minute). The abbreviation QRSS is [Morse code slang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_code) for "transmit a lot slower".

## Project Status: Alpha
This project is so early in development that users are not encouraged to attempt to download or test it. For now this repository will serve as a useful collection of links and notes.

## QRSS Hardware
This repository is exclusively devoted to software. I run a separate repository dedicated to theory, design, construction, and testing of QRSS transmission and reception hardware:
